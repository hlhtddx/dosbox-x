lng_po_converter transforms lng to po syntax:
https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html#PO-Files

most of the stuff looks okay but some needs rework

the .po files have been saved in poedit so they get formatted once and generate .mo files

ensure 'vcpkg install gettext' WARNING: this takes a LOT of time

the translation file should be put in en\LC_MESSAGES\dosbox-x.mo
